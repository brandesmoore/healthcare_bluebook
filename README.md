# Healthcare Bluebook

Examination of medicare utilization and payments for providers and hospitals and to determine how payments have changed and which procedure(s) had the largest change in average payment.

# THE DATA
This project used two public medicare datasets that consisted of over 27 million rows of data. The data was formed around medicare utlization and payments to both providers and hospitals nationwide. 

# THE ASK
We were asked to clean and explore the data to determine:

1. How utilization and payments have changed over time?
2. How are funds distributed based on provider type?
3. How utilization and payments have changed YOY for hospital outpatient services.

My role in the project was to clean and extract information for the hospital outpatient services and create visualizations based on my discoveries. 
# THE TAKEAWAYS
*Challenges*

The most challenging part of the Healthcare Bluebook project was brining in the right amount of data into Python. With over 27M rows, it wasn't the best idea to try to bring in all the data at once. I opted to bring the data in using chunks in Python, which made the data more manageable to analyze.

*Rewards*

Having the opportunity to present real medicare findings to a client was a reward within itself given that I've been learning about medicare payments outside of an academic setting. I liked the simplicity of using Power BI to create the visualizations and am grateful to be able to continue to learn how to collaborate with teammates who have different thought processes and ways of learning.
